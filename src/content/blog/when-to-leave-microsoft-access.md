Microsoft Access is a remarkable piece of software. For decades it gave small and medium businesses the ability to build data-driven tools without needing a development team. If your business runs on Access, it almost certainly has done a lot of heavy lifting over the years.

But there comes a point where Access starts working against you. Here's how to know if you're there.

## The signs it's time to move on

**More than one person needs to use it at once.** Access wasn't built for concurrent multi-user workloads. If you're seeing locked records, corrupted files, or people waiting for each other to close the database, that's not a quirk — it's a structural limitation.

**You've outgrown the machine it lives on.** Access databases that live on a single PC or a shared network drive are fragile. If that machine has a problem, so does the business. Backups help, but they don't solve the underlying architecture.

**Nobody knows how it works anymore.** This is more common than it sounds. The person who built the original database left five years ago. Queries have been modified. Forms have been patched. At some point, people stop trusting the numbers and start double-checking in spreadsheets.

**It's slowing down.** As data volumes grow, Access performance degrades. Queries that used to run in seconds take minutes. Reports that used to be quick become a thing you run overnight.

**You're working around it instead of with it.** If your team exports data to Excel to do analysis, re-enters data from emails because the database can't capture it properly, or maintains a separate system for part of the process — that's the system telling you it doesn't fit anymore.

## What moving on actually looks like

Replacing an Access database isn't just a technical exercise. The database, however imperfect, embeds a huge amount of knowledge about how your business works. The goal isn't to replicate it — it's to understand what it was doing well and build something that does it better.

That means time spent understanding the business before a line of code is written. It means building something that fits the way your team actually works, not the way a generic system assumes you work.

Done right, the result is a system that feels obvious — because it was designed around your problem, not retrofitted to it.
