title: "Why Simple Software Wins Every Time"
description: "The most effective software isn't the most feature-rich — it's the software that solves the right problem cleanly and gets out of the way."

There's a trap that almost every software project falls into at some point. Someone asks for a feature. Then another feature. Then a way to configure the first feature. Before long, the system that was supposed to save time is taking more time to use than the problem it replaced.

We've seen it with Access databases, with spreadsheets that have grown into multi-tab monsters, and with off-the-shelf software that nobody really uses because nobody quite understands it.

## The complexity trap

Software complexity tends to grow in one direction. Once you add a field, a screen, or a workflow, it rarely gets removed — even when the need for it disappears. Over time, the system becomes a record of every decision ever made, rather than a tool for the work being done today.

The result is friction. People build workarounds. Important things get done outside the system. The system stops being trusted.

## Simple isn't the same as limited

When we talk about simple software, we don't mean software that can't do much. We mean software that does exactly what's needed, without the overhead of everything else.

A simple system has a clear model of the problem it solves. Every screen, every field, every button exists for a reason. When something is missing, it's noticeable — and that's a feature, not a bug. It means the system is focused.

## How we approach it

Before we write a line of code, we spend time understanding what the actual problem is. Not the symptoms, not the feature requests — the underlying problem.

Often the answer is simpler than expected. Not because the problem is simple, but because the right solution turns out to be a clean model of a problem that was previously handled through a tangle of workarounds.

That's the goal: software that fits the problem so well it feels obvious in retrospect.
