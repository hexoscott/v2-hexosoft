Custom software gets talked about as if it's always the right answer. It isn't. There are plenty of situations where an off-the-shelf product, a well-configured spreadsheet, or even a manual process is the right call. The goal is to solve the problem — not to build software for its own sake.

So how do you know when custom software genuinely makes sense?

## When it makes sense

**Your problem is specific to how your business works.** Generic software is built for the average case. If your operation has a workflow, a process, or a constraint that doesn't fit the average, you'll spend a lot of time fighting the tool rather than using it. Custom software is built around your specifics, not someone else's assumptions.

**You're spending significant time on workarounds.** Every hour your team spends exporting, reformatting, copy-pasting, or manually reconciling data is a cost. If those hours add up to something meaningful, the maths on custom software often starts to look different.

**You have a clear view of the problem.** This one is underrated. The businesses that get the most from custom software are the ones that can describe their problem clearly — not necessarily the solution, but the problem. If you know what's broken, building something to fix it is tractable. If you're not sure what the problem is, more time spent understanding it will pay off more than building anything.

**You're at a scale where the investment is justified.** Custom software costs money and time to build. It also takes time to adopt. For a business with two people, the equation rarely makes sense. For a business with a team, a real operation, and a problem that's genuinely limiting growth — it often does.

## When it doesn't

If a standard product would do the job, use it. If the problem is that nobody's using the system you already have, more software won't fix that. If the business is still figuring out what it is, locking in a custom system too early can be a constraint rather than an asset.

## The honest answer

The right question isn't "are we ready for custom software?" — it's "do we have a problem that custom software would actually solve?"

If the answer is yes, the next question is whether the cost of building it is justified by the cost of not building it. Sometimes it clearly is. Sometimes it isn't. We'd rather have that honest conversation than sell you something you don't need.
