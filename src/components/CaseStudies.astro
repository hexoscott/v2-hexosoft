          A manufacturing business outgrowing a system held together with spreadsheets and an Access database.

        <p class="font-ui text-sm text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          Prefix had built their operation on Microsoft Access. It had served its purpose — but as the business grew, the cracks showed. Stock was hard to trust, the factory floor ran on paper, customers received inconsistent documentation, and production scheduling was a daily guessing game. They needed a platform built around how they actually work.
